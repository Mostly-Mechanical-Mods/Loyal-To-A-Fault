# Game Concept

game_concept_loyalty: "Loyalty"
game_concept_loyalty_desc: "A [vassal|E]'s Loyalty determines how likely they are to join the $loyalist_faction$, and defend the [realm|E] against domestic threats.\n\nIt depends heavily on their personality, their personal relationship with their liege, and their liege's [tyranny|E].\n\nAlthough loyal [vassals|E] are likely to join the $loyalist_faction$, they might not do so if they're [intimidated|E], or if the liege is in [debt|E] - after all, no one likes to be on the losing side.\n\nFurthermore, a [vassal|E]'s loyalty does not always supersede their personal interest: they might be loyal to the Crown, but seek nonetheless to put another Claimant on the Throne."
